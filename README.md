# Typography Baseline

## I have a normalize/reset, why do I need this?
This isn't meant to replace a normalize or a reset. Keep using your normalize and reset.

## When do I use this?
After you've put your normalize/ reset in place, and when you're looking for a starting place for your brand. This attempts to provide some sort of baseline style for all of the typographical elements.

## what can I change?
Anything and everything. It's a baseline. But if you want to know what to change first, start with the `font-size` for `html` and then move on to colors.

## What about the HTML file?
The HTML file is an attempt to use all of the inline, content-flow, and otherwise odd/obscure semantic elements appropriately. Semantics are hard.
